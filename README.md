# How Much Insulin
Tells you how much insulin to take based on current blood glucose reading and grams of carbs you're about to ingest, based on a custom configuration for each time of the day

# Plans for Hacktoberfest
I'd like to add support for different languages before Hacktoberfest, so that people can participate in the event by helping me here. There would also need to be a **contributing** section here.

# To do
* [ ] support for translations
* [ ] target BG configurable by interval
* [ ] screenshots here
* [ ] use state instead of loading the data from AsyncStorage in each screen
* [ ] export (shares JSON object)
* [ ] style of buttons during press is glitchy on light theme
